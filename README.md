My Mission and Focus
I’m driven to build intelligent, automated systems that merge AI, leadership, and modern business strategy. I work at the intersection of prompt engineering, custom LLM tools, and streamlined no-code deployments (Streamlit, Firebase, Notion). Through CLConsulting, I license advanced AI tools, build enterprise training platforms, and deliver practical cognitive automation.

Collaboration Interests
I’m actively looking for strategic partners in AI automation, executive coaching technology, and educational SaaS. If you’re interested in licensing prompt frameworks, designing LLM workflows, or monetizing intellectual property in this space, we should talk.

A Bit More About Me
I design AI systems that run executive teams, automate high-stakes decisions, and pass as human—often from a single prompt. My approach: real-world impact over AI hype, always.
